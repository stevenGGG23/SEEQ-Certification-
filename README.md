## What is SEEQ?

**SEEQ** is an advanced industrial analytics platform designed for process manufacturing data. It helps engineers and data analysts easily connect, cleanse, model, monitor, and predict process data using time-series analysis. SEEQ enables users to:

- Visualize and explore large sets of process data in real-time  
- Apply data cleansing and preparation techniques  
- Identify patterns and root causes of process anomalies  
- Create dashboards and reports for collaboration and decision-making  
- Use scripting (via **Seeq Data Lab**, powered by Jupyter Notebooks and Python) for advanced analytics and automation
